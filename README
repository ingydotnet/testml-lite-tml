= This is the TestML test suite repository for TestML-Lite.

TestML is an Acmeist unit test framework. This means you can use the same test
suite for many implementations of a software library, written in different
programming languages.

TestML is parsed by Pegex (an Acmeist parsing framework), and Pegex
implementations use TestML for testing. This leads to a bootstrapping issue, so
TestML-Lite was created. It's a subset of the most commonly used parts of
TestML that can be easily hand-parsed.

TestML-Lite is very simple to port, so it can be used for implementations of
Acmeist modules in languages where Pegex and TestML have not yet been ported.
